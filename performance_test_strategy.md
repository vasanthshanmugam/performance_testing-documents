## 2. Performance Testing Philosophy

### 2.1 Performance-First Mindset
Performance is not an afterthought but a fundamental requirement that must be considered from the earliest stages of system design. Every architectural decision should be evaluated for its performance implications.

### 2.2 Shift-Left Approach
Performance testing should be integrated early in the development lifecycle, moving from traditional end-of-cycle testing to continuous performance validation throughout development.

### 2.3 Risk-Based Testing
Testing efforts should be prioritized based on business criticality, user impact, and technical complexity. High-risk components receive more intensive testing coverage.

### 2.4 Continuous Improvement
Performance testing practices should evolve based on lessons learned, industry best practices, and emerging technologies.
